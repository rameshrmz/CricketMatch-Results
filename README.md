  *Runs per Over Graph*
  ---
      Simple grpah helps you to understand how many runs scored in each overs by checking Runs details on the top of each bar. Many of you noticed, while displaying the runs per over in graph, they wont display the Runs information. Its little hard to understand how much runs exactly scored on the particular over. For that, we have added Runs details for over on the top of the bar.
